## [Project 1: Mushroom edibility model](https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProjectDS-Mushrooms)

This is the project I did for a final project of a data science course, where I classified different mushrooms according to their edibility
  * Dataset Source: The dataset used in this project is the Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle, which provides a detailed description of mushroom characteristics.
  * Filtering Techniques: Various filtering techniques were used to handle data preprocessing, including null value checks and categorical variable encoding for effective machine learning model training.
  * Machine Learning Algorithms: The following machine learning algorithms were applied to predict mushroom edibility (Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression).
