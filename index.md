## [Project 1: Mushroom edibility model] (https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProjectDS-Mushrooms)

This is the project I did for a final project of a data science course, where I classified different mushrooms according to their edibility

  * Dataset Source:
The dataset used in this project is the Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle, which provides a detailed description of mushroom characteristics.

  * Filtering Techniques:
Various filtering techniques were used to handle data preprocessing, including null value checks and categorical variable encoding for effective machine learning model training.

  * Machine Learning Algorithms:
The following machine learning algorithms were applied to predict mushroom edibility:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression

## [Project 2: Weather prediction model] (https://github.com/AlvarezLI/ProyectoDSII_ParteI/blob/main/Entrega_Final_Alvarez.ipynb)

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a synthetic dataset designed to classify different climate types. 

 * Data Preprocessing Techniques:
The following data preparation and cleaning techniques were applied:
  - Null value handling and imputation.
  - Categorical variable encoding for machine learning model training.
  - Outlier removal using the interquartile range (IQR) method.

 * Machine Learning Algorithms:
Several classification algorithms were implemented to predict the weather type, including:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier

 * Model Optimization and Evaluation:
Each model was evaluated using key metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix to measure classification performance. Models were compared to identify the best fit for predicting weather types, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to enhance results.
